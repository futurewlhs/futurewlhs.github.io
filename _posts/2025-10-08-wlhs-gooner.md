Just 1 day ago as of making this article, on 10/7/25 the first post on the instagram account [@wlhs_gooner](https://www.instagram.com/wlhs_gooner) was made. 

A lot of attention has been gained around the account, and there is one question that everyone viewing this ominous account is asking. 

<br>

## **Who** ***is*** the WLHS Gooner?

<br>

Lets start with the first post. There is a photo attached that appears to be a locker from the locker rooms downstairs by the weight room and gym. It is a green locker with handwriting that looks like the text "I love twinks," with 3 underlines under it. Does the gooner goon to twinks? Perchance. Below the text is a grate with white goo on it, which looks like cum. If you are unaware, beleive it or not, cum is the result of gooning. Keep that in mind. Cum on the locker shows that the gooner has gooned on the locker. The caption of the post says "It's going to happen again" which it does in the next post.

<br>

The next post has a video attached of cum coming from the bottom of the screen and sticking onto the walls of the corner of a bathroom. The caption "Im looking for the ice truck gooner" is also attached.

<br>

The third post is the gooner walking up to the sign outside the high school and putting cum on it. This was filmed at night, or at least past sunset. The caption reads "It had to happen".

<br>

The final post as of posting this article shows the gooner cumming all over a bathroom stall. A lot of it gets on the dispenser of the toilet seat cover thingys. But, heres where it gets interesting. **The caption reads: Wlhs doakes found this one fast", and if you look at the toilet seat cover thingy dispenser closely, you can see a reflection of the gooner.**

<br>

### WLHS.Doakes

[@wlhs.doakes](https://www.instagram.com/wlhs.doakes) is the main person publicly trying to find out who the WLHS gooner is. They have 2 posts, both screen recordings of WLHS_Gooner's videos with clips from Dexter: Original Sin, with text overlayed. Not much other info than this

<br>

# WLHS REVIEWS
### THIS IS NEW INFO THAT I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN DISCOVERED YET

In videos 3 and 4, there were links to a person named [@wlhsreviews](https://www.instagram.com/wlhsreviews) in the "In this post" tab, but appeared to be removed **while writing the article.** This is a strong case that **WLHSReviews is closely related to or** ***is*** **the WLHS gooner.***

<br>

Their latest post is from 2024, which I originally thought meant that they were now inactive. But now, looking closer, there appears to be a story under the "Vandalism" collection which was added just **7 hours before making this article**, and they are actively commenting on the WLHS gooners' posts.

<br>

## This account is still active.

<br>

On the latest video, WLHS reviews commented, "Don't end up like West Linn News üôè" and then WLHS gooner replied with "What happened to west linn news". **A stupid account about gooning around the high school would not make a fake conversation with themself to lead them off the trail, which means they are** ***NOT*** **the same person.**

<br>

This is all the info I have found out, and I will update this article if breaking information comes out.
